# Important notes

## You can only add extra subjects and write them off on 2nd and 3nd semestar

Oterwise you will be charged and won't be able to remove them because your complete ects study structure (not by semester, WHOLE) isn't satisfied


## Greedy method

Find the easiest and then experiment with harder ones at the end because you can remove them without being chared for 140kn/ects
